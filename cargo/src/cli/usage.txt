cargo{toolchain} {NAME} <COMMAND> [OPTIONS]
  cargo-{NAME} mimics cargo and hence you can use any of the options supported by cargo,
        such as package, lib, example, bin, target-dir or manifest-path for example.
        Those arguments that {BIN_NAME} doesn't know will be forwarded to underlying cargo as is.
